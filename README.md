# My First Try At 2019 Data Science Bowl 
Here is a comparitively simple code for 2019-Data-Science-Bowl \
Thanks to: https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2019 and \

The model with the highest public score but a lower private score is [here](Overfit.ipynb).\
My highest private score using lightboost and xgboost is [here](Highest_Score_0.ipynb).\
code with similar private score was using lightboost, xgboost, neural network and convolutional neural network is [here](Highest_Score_1.ipynb).\
Code for finding the best weights is [here](weights_calculation.ipynb)
